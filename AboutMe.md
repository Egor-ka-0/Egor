Hi, I'm Egor.

This profile is a place where I publish my personal Python projects around quantitative finance, algorithmic trading and data analysis.
Over time, this will become a growing collection of experiments, tools and research-style notebooks that reflect how I think about markets in a systematic way.

The main purpose of these projects is to document my learning process and share it with others who are also exploring quant finance from first principles.
As I learn more, I plan to revisit earlier work, improve the code, add clearer explanations and make the projects more useful as references.

If you are just starting out, some of the simpler repositories may be a good entry point;
if you are more experienced, you might still find ideas to discuss or extend.

If you are also interested in quant finance or Python, feel free to explore the repositories, open issues, or suggest improvements.
